1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
True and False, we write it in the same form as True and false. Eg-True+true will be give me output as 2 because in system True means 1.
2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
AND,OR,NOT
3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Operator A	Operator B	Logical OR Result
True	True	True
True	False	True
False	True	True
False	False	False
Operator A	Operator B	Logical AND result
True	True	True
True	False	False
False	True	False
False	False	False
 
Operator A	Logical NOT Result
True	False
False	True
4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
False
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)
True
5. What are the six comparison operators? 
Python has six comparison operators: less than ( < ), less than or equal to ( <= ), greater than ( > ), greater than or equal to ( >= ), equal to ( == ), and not equal to ( != ).
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
 The “=” is an assignment operator is used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left. The '==' operator checks whether the two given operands are equal or not. If so, it returns true. Otherwise it returns false.
Ex- 4==5
 o/p-False
i=5:
assigning value for i as 5.


7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
1st block-print(“eggs”)
    2nd block-print(“bacon”)
    3rd block- print(“ham”)
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
 spam=int(input())
if spam==1:
        print("hello")
elif spam==2:
        print("howdy")
else:
        print("greetings")
9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
ctrl+c
10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
The Python break statement stops the loop in which the statement is placed. A Python continue statement skips a single iteration in a loop.
11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
range(10) means it will print numbers from 1 to 9 excluding 10.
range(0,10) means it will print numbers from 0 to 9 excluding 10.
range(0,10,1) is same as range(0,10) , the only difference is it has assigned the jump value as 1 , if nothing is mentioned in jump value it means the jump value will be 1 only. 
12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
#while loop method
 i=1
while i<=10:
    print(i)
    i=i+1
#for loop method
for i in range(1,11):
             print(i)
 
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
by using function-
spam.bacon()
